ZFS Raiders of the Lost File

A nice summer day I decided that I did not wish to keep my old hard 
drive. Before throwing it into junk I started the format process. It was
after a couple of minutes that I realized I had not backed up an
important file. Inside that file was a poem. I jumped over the keyboard 
like a madman trying to interrupt the format process. Although I succeeded
in canceling the process,  part of the hard drive had already been 
formatted.

This is a forensics story...
